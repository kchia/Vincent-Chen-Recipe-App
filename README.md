## List of Features / User Stories
For the project I planned to be able to:
* Create recipes
* Have the ability to see them all on the home page
* Being able to edit recipes
* Being able to delete recipes
* Putting in a user aspect

Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to build in a user interface but it is something I want to work on in the future.
 

## List of Technologies Used
The technologies I used to create this are Express, MongoDB, and Handlebars.

## Installation Instructions / Getting Started
Clone it down
Next npm install to make sure you have everything on your local file.

## Issues throughout the process:
I wrote everything else I needed to create in my javascript but ended up just writing one big function. I had to restart because I was getting lost having everything in one block of code. Learned about the importance of breaking things apart into simpler pieces and console logging things to see what was being accessed.
